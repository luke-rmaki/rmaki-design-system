# Colors

Colors are maintained thru three enums: Hue, Saturation, and Lightness located in the gatsby-theme docz directory:

```typescript
export enum Hues {
  Purple = 246,
  Black = 240,
  Accent = 164,
  White = 212,
}

export enum Saturation {
  Purple = 28,
  Black = 7,
  Accent = 68,
  White = 61,
}

export enum Lightness {
  Purple = 48,
  Black = 10,
  Accent = 72,
  White = 91,
}
```

## Main Colors

<SwatchCollection>
  <Swatch color="purple" />
  <Swatch color="black" />
  <Swatch color="accent" />
  <Swatch color="white" />
</SwatchCollection>

## Variants

Variants are produced by adjusting the lightness value using calc.

Add as needed

### Dark variants

#### Dark one

Subtract 1.6% from lightness value

```css
--color-dark-one: hsl(h, s, calc(l - 1.6%));
```

<SwatchCollection>
  <Swatch color="purple-dark-one" />
</SwatchCollection>

#### Dark two

Subtract 3.2% from lightness value

```css
--color-dark-two: hsl(h, s, calc(l - 3.2%));
```

<SwatchCollection>
  <Swatch color="purple-dark-two" />
</SwatchCollection>

### Light variants

#### Light one

Add 10% to lightness value

```css
--color-light-one: hsl(h, s, calc(l + 1.6%));
```

<SwatchCollection>
  <Swatch color="black-light-one" />
</SwatchCollection>
